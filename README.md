# Fullmetal Alchemy

Fullmetal Alchemy is a mod based on the anime of the same name (duhh)!
The aim of this mod is to create a fun, yet balaced way of introducing transmutation to minecraft.

An API will be available for other mods to enable transmutation and other features, or even disable them.

# Dependencies

This mod is currently only dependent on the Baubles mod by Azanor.
