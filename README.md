# Fullmetal Alchemy

Fullmetal Alchemy is a mod based on the anime of the same name (duhh)!

The aim of this mod is to create a fun, yet balaced way of introducing transmutation to minecraft.

An API will be available for other mods to enable transmutation and other features, or even disable them.

# Dependencies

Hard Dependencies:

Baubles by Azanor - for Trinkets.


Soft Dependencies:

Botania by Vazkii and williewillus - For the MultiBlock api

Botania must be set as a module dependency as of current, will be fixed in the future.

# Credits
